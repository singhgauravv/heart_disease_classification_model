### Glossary

1. **[Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)** : Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. The normal distribution appears as a "bell curve" when graphed.

2. **Correlation matrix:** A correlation matrix is simply a table that displays the correlation coefficients for different variables. The matrix depicts the correlation between all the possible pairs of values in a table. It is a powerful tool to summarize a large dataset and to identify and visualize patterns in the given data.

4. [KNeighborsClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)
5. [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)
6. Developing, fine-tuning, and assessing machine learning models:

- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Enhances model performance by finding optimal settings.
- **Feature importance**: Identifies which features most influence the model.
- **Confusion matrix**: Provides detailed insight into classification accuracy and errors.
- **Cross-validation**: Ensures model generalizability and robustness by testing on multiple data splits.
- **Precision**: Indicates the accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the ability to identify all relevant positive instances.
- **F1 score**: Balances precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **Classification report**: Summarizes key classification metrics for comprehensive model evaluation.
- **ROC curve**: Visualizes model performance across different thresholds.
- **Area under the curve (AUC)**: Quantifies overall model performance.
