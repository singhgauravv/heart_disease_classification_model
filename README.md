1. [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) : Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. The normal distribution appears as a "bell curve" when graphed.
