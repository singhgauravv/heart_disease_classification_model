            VitaCardia is a project that allows you to choose amongst our 4
            trained model to make a prediction. Enter you health attributes to
            get started. This is just a fun-project that combines the power of
            python-based machine learning & JavaScript based web dev to result
            in a end-to-end project.

          <ol>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Input Your Health Data:</strong> Enter key health
              attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and
              more into our intuitive interface.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Make a prediction using one of our model:</strong> This
              react client makes a request to the backend node server which in
              turn makes request to a python server that hosts our models. As
              the python server responds, the node server provides the client
              with the required data that gets displyed on the screen.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Why two servers?</strong> Well, python-server is just
              responsible for exposing the trained models. All other business
              logic has been implemented/managed by NodeJs-based ecosystem.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Database & Auth:</strong> I plan to integrate these two on
              the maximum priority.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Model Analysis:</strong> This features might include
              various scientific metrics that you can view to examine the model
              performance. May be a blog section? I don't know, writing about
              such sensitive topics must be done by professionls only.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>More Model</strong> Yes, I will integrate more models
              based on more advanced algorithm.
